[David][guardian-crypto] [Cameron][register-crypto] whilst not being
the smartest cookie in the jar, surely must not have been briefed
properly on what it means to be able to decrypt a message when you
don't have the private key.

The whole notion seems ludicrous, a backdoor to the crypto algorithms
that run the encrypted Internet would have dire consequences if the
backdoor was ever made public.

The ever so "insightful" Louise Mensch has decided that MI6, MI5, GCHQ
and Judges would be the ones with the power to decrypt messages. Maybe
they could start by reading hers?
